# MTConnect

The MTConnect standard (ANSI/MTC1.4-2018) is a domain specific semantic vocabulary for manufacturing equipment. Developers and system integrators use this information model to provide structured, contextualized data with no proprietary format. This reduces translation costs and lets users focus on useful, productive manufacturing applications rather than low level data wrangling. MTConnect data sources include things like production equipment, sensor packages, and other hardware. Applications using MTConnect data provide more efficient operations, improved production optimization, and increased productivity.

For more information on the MTConnect standard refer to the documentation provided at https://www.mtconnect.org/.
